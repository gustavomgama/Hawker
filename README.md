# Hawker
A hawker is someone who goes around their local area selling goods from a vehicle.

The idea came because there's a local hawker in my area who sells doughnuts by car. Sometimes they don't come near my house, and those are exactly the times I really want a doughnut.

This app tells you if there's a driver available in your area, and you can let them know you want something. It shows the driver's location in real time.

The functionality is extremely simple: type your name and address, the driver sees it and comes to you. You can't buy directly through the app or see what products are available - it's just for connecting customers with the mobile vendor.

## How it works

**For customers:**
- See if the driver is online and where they are
- Request service by sharing your name and location
- Wait for the driver to come to you

**For drivers:**
- Start/stop working status
- Share your current location
- See customer requests organized by distance
- Mark requests as complete when done
